# Application Layer

## Overview

The `application` directory contains the orchestration and application-specific logic that coordinates high-level activities within the project. This layer serves as the intermediary between the user interface (e.g., CLI, web API, frontend) and the domain logic, ensuring that user requests are executed in accordance with business rules and workflows defined in the domain layer.

## Structure

- `workflow.py`: Defines the main workflows of the application, orchestrating the sequence of actions that need to be performed in response to various application events or user requests.

- `__init__.py`: Indicates that this directory is a Python package, allowing its modules to be imported elsewhere in the project.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Request Validation**: Ensures that incoming requests from the outer layers (like the frontend or API endpoints) contain all required data in the correct format before passing them down to the domain layer.

2. **Data Transformation**: Converts data between formats suitable for the domain layer and the external layers, ensuring that internal representations are kept consistent while providing flexibility in how data is presented or accepted from the outside.

3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinates complex sequences of domain logic, external service calls, and infrastructure operations based on application-specific rules and scenarios.

4. **Security and Permissions**: Checks that the current user or system has the necessary permissions to perform requested operations, applying any relevant security policies.

5. **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions and errors that occur during the processing of a request, ensuring that they are logged appropriately and that meaningful feedback is provided to the caller.

## Usage

Modules within the `application` directory are typically invoked by the project's entry points (such as FastAPI route handlers in `main.py`) or by scheduled tasks. They can also call upon services provided by the `domain` and `infrastructure` layers to access and manipulate application data.
