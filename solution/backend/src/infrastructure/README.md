# Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure layer in this application serves as the foundation for managing external interfaces and technical details that support the operation of the domain layer. It includes implementations for data access, network communication, file system operations, and other technical details that are abstracted away from the core business logic.

## Overview

This layer acts as the glue between the application's domain logic and the outside world. It provides concrete implementations for interfaces defined in the domain layer, ensuring that data flows seamlessly across system boundaries.

## Contents

- `dataLoader.py`: Implements functionality to load data from various sources (e.g., files, databases, external APIs) into the application. It ensures that raw data is correctly ingested and made available to the domain layer for processing.
- `healthCheck.py`: Provides utilities to perform health checks on the application's infrastructure components, ensuring they are operational and ready to support the application's needs.
- `cleanResults.py`: Contains logic to manage result data, including cleaning, archiving, or deleting outdated or temporary result sets to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the application's data storage.

## Getting Started

To effectively utilize the infrastructure layer, it's important to understand the application's overall architecture and how the domain layer interacts with external systems. Review the implementation details and configuration settings in each component to ensure they align with your application's operational environment and infrastructure requirements.

## Integration with Domain Layer

The infrastructure layer components should be integrated with the domain layer in a way that supports dependency inversion principles. This means that domain logic should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) that are implemented by the infrastructure components, rather than on the concrete implementations directly.

This approach decouples the core business logic from external concerns, making the application more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to changes in external systems or infrastructure technologies.

For detailed information on configuring and extending the infrastructure components, refer to the documentation within each file.
