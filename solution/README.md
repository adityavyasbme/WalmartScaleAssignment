For a clean, reader-friendly README.md for your project, you would include an introduction to the project, instructions on how to set it up and run it, and a concise directory structure with brief explanations for each part. Here's an example of how you might structure it:

Solution Project
Introduction
Briefly describe your project, its goals, and what it achieves. Mention any technologies or frameworks used, like Docker, FastAPI for the backend, Streamlit for the frontend, and MLflow for model tracking.

Quickstart
Instructions on how to get the project running quickly, including any prerequisites like Docker or Python.

Running the Application
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command starts all components of the application, including the backend, frontend, and any services like MLflow.

Project Structure
Below is an overview of the project structure and a brief description of each component:
